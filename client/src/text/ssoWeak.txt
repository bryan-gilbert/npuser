If a hacker breaks into your SSO identity provider, all your linked systems could be open to attack. The risk of this is small because high-quality identity providers have top-notch security but there are no guarantees and some users prefer to not trust a single point of failure.  <br/> With <strong>npuser</strong> there is nothing to hack on the <strong>npuser</strong>  service so, your users are protected.

Setting up an application with SSO can take longer than expected. <br/> With <strong>npuser</strong> your application simply installs the <strong>npuser</strong> library and makes two web service calls with your application's private clientID
During SSO the user is redirected to another company's website and will be redirected back to your application when done.  <br/> With <strong>npuser</strong> the user never leaves your site.
SSO using social networking services may be restricted with workplaces that block social media sites and government connections where censorship is involved. <br/> With <strong>npuser</strong> your application is always available.
Some SSO-linked sites may give their user data to third-party entities. <br/> With <strong>npuser</strong> your user's information is never stored on <strong>npuser</strong> so there is nothing that can be shared.
